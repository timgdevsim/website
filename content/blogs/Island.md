Unreal level editor

  - All the assets present here are dowloaded from the Unreal market.
  - The tente surfaces are dynamic and react to the wind.
  - The land is build in the editor.

Unreal blueprint

  - You can use controller or the mouse (Or both at the same time if you want to ally precision movement and aiming).
  - The drag and drop object system allow precise placement.
  - The held object is showed on screen with a well placed grabconstraint.
  - Text and mecanism are activated when the right object is dropped on the right place.
